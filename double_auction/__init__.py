Double Auction Market Experiment

This module implements a continuous double auction where buyers and sellers
can submit bids and asks respectively. When compatible offers meet (bid â‰¥ ask),
trades execute automatically at the offered price.

The auction follows these principles:
- Each participant is either a buyer (with a value) or seller (with a cost)
- Buyers profit when purchasing below their value
- Sellers profit when selling above their cost
- Trades occur when a buyer accepts an ask or a seller accepts a bid
