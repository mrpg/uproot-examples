# uproot examples

The folders in this repository contain [uproot](https://uproot.science/) examples.

*Note*: Normal users of uproot (those who are not working on the uproot core) can skip the folder `_internal`. That folder contains example apps intended for testing and benchmarking backend features.

## Running all examples

This repository is also an uproot *project*. That means: you can clone it and run `uproot run` to enjoy these example apps *all at once* from the comfort of your home.
