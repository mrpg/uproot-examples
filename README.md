# uproot examples

The folders in this repository contain [uproot](https://uproot.science/) example apps.

*Note*: Normal users of uproot (those who are not working on the uproot core) can skip the folder `_internal`. That folder contains example apps intended for testing and benchmarking backend features.

## Running all examples

**NEW**: This repository is now also an uproot *project*. That means: you can clone it and run `uproot run` to enjoy these examples *all at once* in the comfort of your home.
