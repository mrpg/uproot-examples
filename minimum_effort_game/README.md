# minimum\_effort\_game

The minimum effort or weakest link coordination game (Van Huyck, Battalio, & Beil, 1990). Players simultaneously choose effort levels from 1 to 7. Payoffs depend on the minimum effort in the group and the player's own effort.

This game has multiple Pareto-ranked Nash equilibria. The efficient equilibrium (all choose 7) is risky because payoffs depend on the lowest effort in the group.
