# gift\_exchange\_game

The gift exchange game (Fehr, Kirchsteiger, & Riedl, 1993). An employer sets a wage, then a worker observes the wage and chooses an effort level. Effort is costly for the worker but benefits the employer.

Under standard assumptions, the worker should choose minimal effort regardless of wage. However, experiments typically show that workers reciprocate higher wages with higher effort.
